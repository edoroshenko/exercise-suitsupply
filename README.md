#What is done:
1. Basic entities of MVC pattern
2. Basic implementation of Observer pattern
3. Partition an app into semantic entities
4. Implementation of application-specific entities and their logic
5. Basic stylizing of the interface


#What is missing (out of the task):
1. Input data validation. I expect input data to match the example format.
2. Server errors handling. I use my own source, that returns a content of the static file.
3. Templating system. I used DOM API to create elements. It's not the best way of creating HTML. The best way is a kind of declarative templating system.
4. Unit tests. Entities should be tested.
5. Building tools. Javascript and css files should be merged into one, minified and uglified
