What is done:
1. Basic entities of MVC pattern
2. Basic implementation of Observer pattern
3. Partition an app into semantic entities
4. Implementation of application-specific entities and their logic
5. Basic stylizing of the interface


What is missing (out of the task):
1. Input data validation. I expect input data to match the example format.
2. Templating system. I used DOM API to create elements. It's not the best way of creating HTML. The best way is a kind of declarative templating system.
3. Unit tests. Entities should be tested.
4. Building tools. Javascript and css files should be merged into one, minified and uglified
